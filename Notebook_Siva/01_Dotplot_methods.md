### Dotplots
In order to visualize pairwise comparison between sequences we used a desktop app ([re-DOT-able](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/redotable/) ) from Babraham Bioinformatics to plot  interactively and also save the figures. For detailed information; Simon Andrews, the developer has a really good [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPxl2hflG9Q&feature=emb_logo).

We made pairwise comparisons between the reference genome and each of the seven assembled genomes to look for insert location and for any genome re-arrangements. In order to check the location Additionally we also plotted each assembly against the relevant insert sequences.
