# finding insert locations trough dotplots :


Purpose of this section was trying to confirm the insert location considering the location of the another insert section that the location is known on the reference genome !

I started this but soon figured it is not helpful because these sections are in different contigs.

## 2017 reference genome


|barcode |  insert 2 location | checkpoint insert location |
|---|---|---|
|barcode 13| scafold-3,1109002*2(f & r)| contig 23, 1117119 |
|barcode 16|
