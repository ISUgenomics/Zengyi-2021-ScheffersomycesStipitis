```bash
module load gcc/7.3.0-xegsmw4
module load nextflow

module load singularity
nextflow run ../../../Programfiles/nanoQCtrim --fastqs  ../00-RawData/barcode13/FAO68114_pass_barcode13_598c81f2_*.fastq

```

I asked Andrew and there were several problems with the way I wanted to run it !
1. I need to run `/work/gif/Maryam/Programfiles/nanoQCtrim/main.nf` !
2. I need `nova` profile so the jobs are submitted and `singularity` to load the singularity module and pull the containers.
3. Andrew suggested that I concatenate the fastq files for each system and run but everything was so quick and easy that I decided to run as it is.


The correct command :
```nextflow run /work/gif/Maryam/Programfiles/nanoQCtrim/main.nf --fastqs ../00-RawData/barcode13/FAO68114_pass_barcode13_598c81f2_*.fastq --outdir output-barcode13 -profile singularity,nova
```

This was finished very fast ( less than a minute). So I decided to just submit all of them jobs from a loop file:

```bash
for n in 4 5 6 7 8 9
 do
 nextflow run /work/gif/Maryam/Programfiles/nanoQCtrim/main.nf --fastqs ../00-RawData/barcode1$n/FAO68114_pass_barcode1$n_598c81f2_*.fastq --outdir output-barcode1$n -profile singularity,nova
 done
```
All the jobs finished quickly.
